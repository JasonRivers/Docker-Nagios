# This compose file acts as an example on using docker volumes for nagios
# configuration. As nagios configurations are different for each site they are
# not considered part of the container image. The best way to deal with the
# configurations is to store them in a volume allowing the user to upgrade the
# image without the need to extract the site configuration from the container.
